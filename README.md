# Sckoopy Web API

## ‚ú® **Overview**

The **Sckoopy Web API** is a robust and scalable API designed to handle modern web application needs with an efficient architecture. This project utilizes **.NET 8**, **Entity Framework Core**, and a multi-layered architecture to ensure maintainability, flexibility, and performance. The API was developed with best practices in mind, making it easy to scale and integrate with various platforms.

## üåç **Features**

- **RESTful Endpoints**: Offers clean and predictable RESTful APIs for easy integration.
- **Multi-layered Architecture**: Separation of concerns with distinct layers:
  - **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
  - **Service Layer**: Encapsulates business logic.
  - **Data Access Layer**: Manages database interactions with **Entity Framework Core**.
- **Cloud Integration**: Hosted on **Azure** with database and API running on Azure services for high availability.
- **Authentication-Ready**: Uses a token-based authentication mechanism for secure API consumption.
- **CORS Enabled**: Configured to allow cross-origin requests, making it flexible for frontend integration.
- **Cloudinary Integration**: Handles media uploads seamlessly using the Cloudinary service.

## üìä **Technologies Used**

- **.NET 8**: The backbone of the API for building scalable and high-performance web applications.
- **Entity Framework Core**: Simplifies database interactions while supporting migrations and complex queries.
- **Cloudinary SDK**: For media management and upload functionality.
- **Azure**: For hosting both the database and the API.
- **SQL Server**: Robust database solution integrated with **Entity Framework**.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Details**

### üé® Architecture

This project implements a **multi-layered architecture** to ensure a clean separation of concerns:

1. **Controller Layer**:

   - Receives and processes HTTP requests.
   - Handles route definitions and delegates operations to the service layer.

2. **Service Layer**:

   - Contains all the business logic.
   - Acts as a bridge between the controller and the data access layer.

3. **Data Access Layer**:

   - Built using **Entity Framework Core**.
   - Manages database operations such as CRUD functionality.
   - Abstracted into a repository-like structure to make the code testable and maintainable.

---

### üèõÔ∏è Database Integration

- **Entity Framework Core** was utilized to connect to a **SQL Server** database hosted on **Azure**.
- The database connection string is managed through **environment variables** for enhanced security and flexibility.
- Migrations were used to manage database schema changes efficiently.

Example of the connection string in the project:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddDbContext<AppDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SQL_CONNECTION_STRING")));
```

### ‚ú® API Highlights

- **Endpoints**:
  - `POST /users`: Create a new user.
  - `GET /posts`: Retrieve all posts.
  - `POST /comments`: Add a comment to a post.
  - `POST /upload`: Upload a file to Cloudinary.
- **Secure Access**:
  - The API supports token-based authentication .
  - Swagger was configured for testing but disabled in production for security purposes.
- **Cloudinary Integration**:
  - Configured to store and retrieve media files.
  - Cloudinary credentials are securely stored in environment variables.

Example of Cloudinary configuration:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton(c => {
    var cloudinary = new Cloudinary(new Account(
        Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME"),
        Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("CLOUDINARY_API_KEY"),
        Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET")
    ));
    return cloudinary;
});
```
